# tourneydraft
A game I played with family and friends that I turned into an app.

TLDR:
- Get a group of 8
- Live draft 8 teams each from the field of 64 NCAA March Madness Tournament teams
- Receive points for wins dependent on seed number and round number
- Whoever receives most points wins a portion of money
- Whoever picked overall tournament winner receives portion of money

The basic functionality is that you can create a league and add your friends to it. The league can then hold events corresponding to sports tournaments in the real world. For simplicity's sake I will only have it work for the NCAA March Madness tournament.
Once the field of 64 is determined for the tournament, your league is able to conduct a draft of the teams.
Typically this is done in modified snake fashion with 8 players where the first round is inverted for the second round and the players are reordered for the next grouping of two rounds until all 8 rounds are complete and all 64 teams have been drafted.

You then receive points for your drafted teams winning the actual games.
You receive the number value of the seed of your team plus the number value of the round of the tournament.
For example: #16 seed UMBC upsets #1 seed UVA in the first round and you receive 16 + 1 = 17 points.
This point system places a lot of value on upsets and cinderella teams, which we have anecdotally found makes the tournament even more fun to watch.
